                <h1>Religion</h1>
                Primary Author
                Nina Evason, 2017
                Spirituality is central to the Nepali people and society. In 2014, a poll found that 93% of Nepali
                respondents considered religion to be important to their daily life. Nepal’s cultural heritage is deeply
                influenced by religion. For example, Buddha was born in Lumbini - a sacred garden in Nepal and UNESCO
                World Heritage Site. Though the monarchy has lost its autocratic power, some Nepalis may still consider
                the King of Nepal to be an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu.


                In the 2011 Nepali census, 81.3% of the population identified as Hindu and 9% identified as Buddhist.
                The census also identified significant groups of Muslims (4.4%), Kirant (3.1%) and Christians (1.4%).
                Hinduism is generally followed by Indo-Aryan ethnicities and is widespread throughout the nation.
                Buddhism is more concentrated in areas where Tibetan cultural influences are dominant and is mostly
                followed by the Tibeto-Burman ethnicities in the North and in the centre. However, this general
                correlation between ancestry and religion is not concrete. Many Tibeto-Burmans are Hindu and vice versa.


                Nepal has not seen major inter-religious conflicts as its neighbouring countries have. There is little
                isolation and judgement between faiths. Instead, there has been a lot of intermingling between the
                religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Many people may identify as an amalgamation of these two faiths as
                they share similar ideas of rebirth (samsara) and causality (karma). Nepali adherents of both syncretic
                religions are historically known to worship at each other’s temples and celebrate each other's
                festivals. In this way, despite having a defined Hindu majority, there tends to be a dominant feeling of
                mutual respect throughout Nepal regarding other people’s devotion to their faith and belief system. As
                an example, a Christian Church of the Lady of Assumption was painted by Buddhist monks. This attitude of
                acceptance has largely translated into respect for the values and traditions of other cultures among
                Nepali diaspora communities.

                <h1>Traditional Beliefs in Nepal</h1>
                The current census statistics of Nepal do not reflect the ongoing shamanic and animist traditions in the
                country. Indigenous ethnicities commonly continue to follow their traditional belief system. For
                example, the Tharu people from the Tarai region have a spiritual system that is closely linked to the
                natural environment. There is also a widespread belief in witchcraft, ghosts and spirits in rural parts
                of Nepal. These supernatural beings are thought to have spiteful natures, often seeking to inflict
                illness and misfortune. Many Nepalis seek shamans (‘jhhakhri’) to discover the cause of illness by
                mediating between the supernatural realm and the human world. These shamans then recommend treatment or
                devotions one can do to regain health. There are many cultural taboos that relate to these traditional
                beliefs. For example, uttering the word “witch” in Nepali is thought to bring a witch’s attention upon
                you and cause you harm. Many Nepalis combine traditional practices with their religious worship;
                Hinduism and the practice of ‘puja’ is commonly intermingled with shamanism.

                <h1>Hinduism in Nepal</h1>

                Hinduism – the most widely followed religion in Nepal – has been particularly influential in Nepali
                society, yet it can be interpreted in many different ways. Pinpointing what constitutes Hinduism is
                complex, with some contending that the religion is rather an umbrella term that encompasses various
                religions and traditions within it. Followers of the faith often perform many rituals; these may happen
                once in a lifetime or annually in the form of a colourful festival. They may also happen regularly on a
                day-to-day basis. For instance, one common Hindu ritual is ‘puja’, which is the making of offerings and
                prayers to particular gods and deities. Some believe that making specific gestures to the Gods can
                remove obstacles and bad luck. Therefore, people commonly worship and pray before events or actions,
                like a wedding, funeral or long journey. Puja may also be performed to ask for forgiveness. Sometimes,
                priests (who have a prominent position in Hindu society) may ask for the forgiveness of Gods on behalf
                of others.


                Many Hindu temples are built around Nepal in honour of various Gods and deities. They provide a place of
                solace, prayer and ritual for followers. Some have very specific purposes. For example, the
                Pashupatinath temple is the most significant temple dedicated to the god Shiva. It is believed that
                those who die in that temple will be reincarnated as a human in their next life, and so many elderly
                Hindus travel there to live their last weeks of life in the temple, eventually die and become cremated.
                Their remains are put into the sacred river, which eventually meets the holy river Ganges.


                One of the most visible influences of Hinduism on Nepali society is the ‘varna’ (caste) system, a
                normative ideal of how society ought to be structured. It was adopted in Nepal, but in practice became
                complicated by various factors. Stigma was attached to those within particular castes and interactions
                among them were limited, particularly between those on the bottom tier and their superiors. Today,
                discrimination based on one’s caste is outlawed. However, prejudices based on caste do exist, even if
                implicit. See Social Hierarchies in Core Concepts for more information on caste.

                <h1>Buddhism in Nepal</h1>

                Buddhism originated as a countermovement to early Hinduism. It sought to present a universal ethic
                rather than ethical codes based on an individual’s caste. The core doctrine of the religion, known as
                the ‘Four Noble Truths’, teaches that one can be liberated from the suffering that underpins the cycle
                of death and rebirth by practising the ‘The Eightfold Path’. The ‘Five Precepts of Buddhism’ also set
                out commandments of correct and moral behaviour.


                There are three main traditions or variations of Buddhism followed in Nepal: Theravada Buddhism,
                Mahayana Buddhism and Vajrayana Buddhism. Across all three of these Buddhist traditions, reverence
                towards the Buddha is an important principle. Theravada Buddhism, known as ‘the way of the elders’, is
                seen by its followers as the earliest and most unchanged form of Buddhism. Theravada Buddhists generally
                take refuge in the ‘Triple Gem’: the teacher (Buddha), the teaching (dhamma) and the monastic community
                (the Sangha).


                Mahayana Buddhism is known as the ‘Great Vehicle’ towards enlightenment. It considers its interpretation
                and additions to the original Buddha doctrine to be legitimate. Compassion is highly valued in Mahayana
                Buddhism; those who become enlightened (bodhisattvas) are thought to be able to postpone their own
                ascension to nirvana out of their own goodwill and sense of compassion in order to assist others along
                the path to enlightenment.


                Vajrayana Buddhism (Tibetan Buddhism), known as the ‘Diamond’ or ‘Thunderbolt Vehicle’, is seen by some
                followers as a quicker path to enlightenment than other Buddhist traditions. It’s generally followed by
                exiled monks of Tibet and some Nepalis of Tibetan-Burman backgrounds living at high altitudes. Like
                Mahayana, it emphasises the role of bodhisattvas. It is often referred to as Tantric Buddhism because of
                the literature and rituals it follows. It involves many devotions to be performed through rituals such
                as mandalas, mantras and other exercises. These are taught through a guru, such as the Dalai Lama, who
                has mastered the philosophical and ritual tradition.
