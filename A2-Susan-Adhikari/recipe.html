    <h1>About Momo:</h1>

        <p>Momos are a type of dumpling originating from Tibet and Nepal but now widely popular across the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. They are typically made with a simple dough of flour, water, and salt, which is then filled with various ingredients such as minced meat (commonly chicken, pork, or lamb), vegetables, tofu, or cheese, seasoned with herbs and spices, and then steamed or sometimes fried.
            <br><br>

            The word "momo" is believed to have been derived from a Tibetan word meaning "steamed bread." Momos can be served with a variety of dipping sauces, such as tomato-based chutneys, spicy sauces, or soy sauce-based dips.
            <br><br>
            
            Momos are a popular street food and can also be found in restaurants specializing in Tibetan, Nepali, or other regional cuisines. They are often enjoyed as a snack or appetizer but can also be part of a larger meal. Their versatility and delicious taste have contributed to their widespread popularity in various parts of the world.

                Prepare the dough:<br>

                In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.<br>
                Gradually add water and knead until you have a smooth and pliable dough.<br>
                Cover the dough and let it rest for about 30 minutes.

                Prepare the filling:<br>

                Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and ginger, and saut√© for a minute until
                fragrant.<br>



                Add chopped onions and cook until translucent.<br>
                Add chopped mixed vegetables and cook for 3-4 minutes until they are slightly softened but still retain
                their crunch.<br>
                Season with soy sauce, vinegar, salt, and pepper. <br>Mix well and cook for another 2 minutes.<br>
                Remove from heat and let the filling cool down completely.<br>

                Assemble the momos:<br>

                Divide the rested dough into small portions and roll each portion into a thin circle, about 3-4 inches
                in
                diameter.<br>
                Place a spoonful of the vegetable filling in the center of each dough circle.<br>
                To shape the momos, fold the edges of the dough circle towards the center, pleating and sealing them
                together to form a half-moon shape. Make sure to seal the edges tightly to prevent the filling from
                leaking.<br>

                Steam the momos:<br>

                Arrange the shaped momos on a greased steamer basket or tray, making sure to leave some space between
                them
                to prevent sticking.<br>
                Steam the momos for 10-12 minutes until the dough is cooked through and the filling is heated.<br>
