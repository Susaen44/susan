    <h3><u>My background:</u></h3>
    <p id="background">
        I am from Nepal which is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also
        includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and
        India to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and
        from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine
        forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on
        Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual,
        multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language.
        <br>
        I have completed my high school in 2019 from Kathmandu Model College, kathamandu, Nepal.After my study,I was
        enrolled to the pokhara University for my higher studies but I don't get the practical education as I expected
        so i decided to dorp the university and decided to begin the new journey to canada and starting my journey as a
        computer programmer.

    <h3><u>My Hobbies:</u></h3>
    
    <dl class="hobbies">
        <dt><u>Travelling:</u></dt>
        <dd>Travelling is an amazing way to learn a lot of things in life. A lot of people around the world travel every
            year to many places. Moreover, it is important to travel to humans. Some travel to learn more while some
            travel to take a break from their life. No matter the reason, travelling opens a big door for us to explore
            the world beyond our imagination and indulge in many things. Therefore, through this Essay on Travel, we
            will go through everything that makes travelling great.</dd>
        <dt><u>Listening to music:</u></dt>
        <dd>Music is a vital part of different moments of human life. It spreads happiness and joy in a person’s life.
            Music is the soul of life and gives immense peace to us. In the words of William Shakespeare, “If music is
            the food of love, play on, Give me excess of it; that surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die.”
            Thus, Music helps us in connecting with our souls or real self.</dd>
